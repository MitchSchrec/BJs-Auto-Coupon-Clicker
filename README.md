# BJs Auto Coupon Clicker

This project uses puppeteer to auto click your BJs coupons. I would recommend deploying this project on Heroku and using its scheduler function to run every morning to ensure all coupons are always clipped.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to install.

```bash
npm install
```
